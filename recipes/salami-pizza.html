    <h1>Salami Pizza</h1>
<img src="../images/salami-pizza.jpg" alt="">
    <p><strong>Description: Homemade Salami Pizza</strong> <br><br>Create a delicious homemade salami pizza by starting with a pre-made pizza dough or making your own. Roll out the dough into your desired shape and thickness. Spread a generous layer of tomato sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a border for the crust. Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese on top for a gooey base. Arrange thin slices of your favorite salami over the cheese. Enhance the flavors with sliced red onions and a sprinkle of dried oregano. Drizzle a bit of olive oil over the toppings to help them cook and brown. Bake in a preheated oven according to the dough's instructions, usually around 12-15 minutes or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly. After baking, let the pizza cool for a moment before slicing into savory, salami-topped slices.</p>
